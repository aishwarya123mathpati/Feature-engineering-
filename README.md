# Feature-engineering for Predictive Modeling on a Sales Dataset
This project demonstrates the importance of feature engineering, which involves transforming raw data into features that make machine learning algorithms perform better. The dataset we'll be using is a Sales Data dataset, which includes various columns like sales figures, regions, and time-related features. The main task is to predict sales based on historical data by extracting, creating, and selecting appropriate features.

# Objective
- Problem: Predict sales for a given store based on historical sales and additional attributes such as store location, weather, and holidays.
Approach: We will work on:
- Data cleaning (handling missing data, outliers, etc.)
- Feature creation (using domain knowledge to create new features)
- Feature transformation (normalization, encoding)
- Feature selection (removing irrelevant features)

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of sales data from various stores with the following features:

- Store ID: A unique identifier for each store.
- Date: Date of the sales record.
- Sales: The total sales amount.
- Temperature: Temperature for the day.
- Holiday: Whether it was a holiday (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- Weekday: Day of the week.
- Promo: Whether a promotion was held on that day (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- Region: The region of the store (e.g., North, South, East, West).
